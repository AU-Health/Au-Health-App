# Directory for survey images - contains:

- finalized images
- AI files for future devs incase edits want to be made
- SVG files for same reason (smaller files)
- individual images available for editing
- see sketches.AI for all adjustable, individual vectors
- clean components: scratch files are compiled into a scratch/concept directory. Same as components but includes sleep final wheel and cleaner layout. 

## *** Note: when ready to export for screen, ALWAYS export your AI file as an SVG. SVGs are completely scalable, meaning you can resize the image to any size and still preserve the integrity of the image (it won't become pixilated or blurry)

## Tutorials
- Fitting your AI images into wheel shapes:
  - Step 1: Locate the "wheel-final.ai" file under Final-imgs/final-wheels and open this file
  - to load images into individual shapes, simply follow this tutorial (example tutorial: https://logosbynick.com/crop-an-image-to-a-shape-with-illustrator/)

- Exporting your images into code: 
  - If you would prefer to make edits using javascript, css, html style code (or prefer to embed this way):
    - On illustrator, go to file, export, and then SVG (always select SVG for export regardless of whether you are exporting for code or simply for the image itself.) 
    - Select options pictured below:
